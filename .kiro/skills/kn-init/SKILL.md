# Session Initialization

**Announce:** "Using kn-init to initialize session."

**Core principle:** READ DOCS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

## Inputs

- Optional user focus such as a task ID, feature area, bug, or question
- Current project root already opened in the agent session

## Preflight

- Confirm this is a Knowns project
- Prefer project docs over guessing from code structure
- If `README`, `ARCHITECTURE`, or `CONVENTIONS` do not exist, choose the closest equivalents from the docs list
- If a doc is large, read its TOC first and only open the relevant sections

## Step 1: List Docs

```json
mcp__knowns__list_docs({})
```

## Step 2: Read Core Docs

```json
mcp__knowns__get_doc({ "path": "README", "smart": true })
mcp__knowns__get_doc({ "path": "ARCHITECTURE", "smart": true })
mcp__knowns__get_doc({ "path": "CONVENTIONS", "smart": true })
```

## Step 3: Check Current State

```json
mcp__knowns__list_tasks({ "status": "in-progress" })
mcp__knowns__get_board({})
```

## Step 4: Summarize

```markdown
## Session Context
- **Project**: [name]
- **Key Docs**: README, ARCHITECTURE, CONVENTIONS
- **In-progress tasks**: [count]
- **Current risks / gaps**: [missing docs, unclear conventions, broken search, etc.]
- **Ready for**: tasks, docs, questions
```

## Final Response Contract

All built-in skills in scope must end with the same user-facing information order: `kn-init`, `kn-spec`, `kn-plan`, `kn-research`, `kn-implement`, `kn-verify`, `kn-doc`, `kn-template`, `kn-extract`, and `kn-commit`.

Required order for the final user-facing response:

1. Goal/result - state what session context was established or what was confirmed.
2. Key details - include only the most important supporting context, refs, risks, or current-state notes.
3. Next action - recommend a concrete follow-up command only when a natural handoff exists.

Keep this concise for CLI use. Skill-specific content may extend the key-details section, but must not replace or reorder the shared structure.

Out of scope: explaining, syncing, or generating `.claude/skills/*`. Runtime auto-sync already handles platform copies, so this skill source only defines the built-in output contract.

For `kn-init`, the key details should cover:

- 1 short paragraph or bullet list summarizing project purpose and architecture
- 1 short list of the most relevant docs opened
- current in-progress work, if any
- current risks or missing context, if any

## Fallbacks

- If task search/list is unavailable, state that clearly and continue with docs + codebase context
- If core docs are missing, say which docs were not found and which substitutes were used
- Do not invent project conventions that were not found in docs or code

When a follow-up is natural, recommend exactly one next command such as:

```
/kn-plan <task-id>
/kn-research <query>
```
