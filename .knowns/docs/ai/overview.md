## Architecture

```
.knowns/skills/              # Source of truth
├── knowns-task/SKILL.md
├── knowns-doc/SKILL.md
└── create-component/SKILL.md

# Auto-sync to platforms
.claude/skills/              # Claude Code
.agent/skills/               # Antigravity
.cursor/rules/               # Cursor

## Quick Start

```bash
# Init with AI platforms
knowns init --ai claude,antigravity,cursor,gemini

# Create skill
knowns skill create my-skill

# Sync to all platforms
knowns skill sync --all

# Setup MCP (auto-configures for installed binary)
knowns mcp setup
```

---
# Init with AI platforms
knowns init --ai claude,antigravity,cursor,gemini

# Create skill
knowns skill create my-skill

# Sync to all platforms
knowns skill sync --all

# Setup MCP
knowns mcp setup
```

## Key Concepts

### Skills
Instructions for AI workflows. Portable format (`SKILL.md`) between Claude Code and Antigravity.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Allows AI to call Knowns functions directly instead of CLI commands.
