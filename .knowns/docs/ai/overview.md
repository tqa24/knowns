## Quick Start

```bash
# Init with AI platforms
knowns init

# Sync skills + instructions to platform dirs
knowns sync

# Setup MCP (auto-configures for installed binary)
knowns mcp setup
```

## Key Concepts

### Skills
Instructions for AI workflows. Portable format (`SKILL.md`) across compatible platforms, with Knowns syncing them into the platform-specific skill directories each runtime discovers.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Allows AI to call Knowns functions directly instead of CLI commands.
