## Overview

Semantic search quality is degraded by six issues discovered during code review of `internal/search/` and RAG industry research (@doc/research/rag-chunking-strategies-research). This spec addresses missing model-specific prefixes, lost H1 content during chunking, inaccurate token estimation for non-English text, missing max_tokens enforcement for task chunks, lack of code block awareness in heading parser, and incomplete header hierarchy tracking.

Related: @doc/specs/semantic-search (original spec)

## Locked Decisions

- D1: Scope covers 6 issues — model prefix (high), H1 content loss (medium), EstimateTokens multilingual (medium), task chunk max_tokens split (medium), code block detection in heading parser (medium), full header path tracking (medium).
- D2: Config-driven prefix — add `QueryPrefix`/`DocPrefix` fields to `EmbeddingModelConfig`. Embedder exposes `EmbedQuery()` and `EmbedDocument()` methods that auto-prepend the correct prefix. Existing `Embed()` remains as raw (no prefix) for backward compat.
- D3: Use real tokenizer for token counting — chunker receives a tokenizer dependency to count tokens accurately instead of the `len(text)/4` heuristic. `EstimateTokens` remains as fallback when tokenizer is nil.
- D4: Auto-detect + reindex — store a `chunkVersion` in vector store metadata. On search init, compare stored version against current version constant. If outdated, auto-trigger reindex with progress logging.
- D5: Code block awareness — heading parser must track fenced code blocks and skip heading detection inside them. Follows LlamaIndex/LangChain pattern.
- D6: Full header path tracking — replace `parentSection` (H2-only) with a header stack that tracks the full hierarchy path (e.g., `"API/Endpoints/GET /users"`). Follows LlamaIndex `header_stack` pattern.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- FR-1: Model-specific query/document prefixes must be applied during embedding. Models that require prefixes (bge-small-en-v1.5, bge-base-en-v1.5, nomic-embed-text-v1.5, multilingual-e5-small) must have their prefixes defined in `EmbeddingModelConfig` and applied automatically.
- FR-2: Document content between H1 and the first H2 must be captured during chunking, not silently dropped.
- FR-3: Token counting in the chunker must use the model's actual tokenizer when available, falling back to heuristic estimation only when tokenizer is nil.
- FR-4: Task chunks that exceed the model's max_tokens must be split by paragraph, matching the existing behavior for document chunks.
- FR-5: A chunk version constant must be maintained. When the stored version in the vector store differs from the current version, the system must auto-reindex on first search initialization.
- FR-6: The heading parser must detect fenced code blocks (triple-backtick delimiters) and skip heading detection inside them. Lines like `# comment` inside code blocks must not be treated as markdown headings.
- FR-7: Each chunk must track the full header hierarchy path (e.g., `"API/Endpoints/GET /users"`) using a header stack, replacing the current `parentSection` field that only tracks the nearest H2.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: Tokenizer-based counting must not add more than 50ms overhead per chunk on average (chunking is already I/O-bound by embedding).
- NFR-2: Auto-reindex must show progress to the user (reuse existing `ReindexProgress` callback).
- NFR-3: All changes must be backward-compatible — existing indexes work until auto-reindex runs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: `EmbeddingModelConfig` has `QueryPrefix` and `DocPrefix` string fields. bge models use `"Represent this sentence: "` for queries. nomic uses `"search_query: "` / `"search_document: "`. e5 uses `"query: "` / `"passage: "`. gte and MiniLM have empty prefixes.
- [ ] AC-2: `Embedder` exposes `EmbedQuery(text string)` and `EmbedDocument(text string)` that prepend the appropriate prefix before embedding. `Embed()` remains unchanged (no prefix).
- [ ] AC-3: Search engine uses `EmbedQuery()` for query embedding. Index service uses `EmbedDocument()` for chunk embedding.
- [ ] AC-4: `ChunkDocument` captures content between H1 and the first H2 — either appended to the metadata chunk or as a separate chunk.
- [ ] AC-5: Chunker accepts an optional tokenizer. When provided, token counting uses `tokenizer.Encode()` length instead of `EstimateTokens()`.
- [ ] AC-6: `ChunkTask` splits fields that exceed max_tokens by paragraph, producing multiple chunks with `"(continued)"` suffix, matching `ChunkDocument` behavior.
- [ ] AC-7: A `ChunkVersion` constant exists (initial value: `2`). `SQLiteVectorStore` stores and checks this version. When version mismatch is detected during `InitSemantic`, auto-reindex is triggered.
- [ ] AC-8: `embedding_stub.go` (non-cgo build) compiles without errors — `EmbedQuery`/`EmbedDocument` stubs return `ErrSemanticRuntimeUnavailable`.
- [ ] AC-9: `extractHeadings` tracks fenced code block state (triple-backtick toggle). Headings inside code blocks are ignored. A document with `# comment` inside a code block produces zero heading chunks for that line.
- [ ] AC-10: `Chunk` struct replaces `ParentSection string` with `HeaderPath string` (e.g., `"API/Endpoints/GET /users"`). `extractHeadings` maintains a header stack that pops entries of equal or higher level when a new heading is encountered, producing the full path for each section.
- [ ] AC-11: `SQLiteVectorStore` schema migrates `parent_section` column to `header_path`. Existing indexes are rebuilt via auto-reindex (AC-7).
- [ ] AC-12: Existing unit tests pass. New tests cover: prefix application, H1 content capture, tokenizer-based counting, task chunk splitting, version-triggered reindex, code block heading skip, and header path hierarchy.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Search with bge model (prefix applied)
**Given** semantic search is configured with `bge-small-en-v1.5`
**When** user searches for "authentication flow"
**Then** the query is embedded as `"Represent this sentence: authentication flow"` and documents were indexed with `"Represent this sentence: "` prefix

### Scenario 2: Document with content under H1
**Given** a document where text appears between the H1 title and the first H2 heading
**When** the document is chunked
**Then** that intro text is captured in the metadata chunk or a dedicated intro chunk — not silently dropped

### Scenario 3: Vietnamese task description
**Given** a task with a 2000-character Vietnamese description and model max_tokens=512
**When** the task is chunked with tokenizer available
**Then** token count is measured by tokenizer (likely ~800+ tokens for Vietnamese), and the description is split into multiple chunks each under 512 tokens

### Scenario 4: Long task notes split
**Given** a task with implementation notes exceeding max_tokens
**When** `ChunkTask` processes the task
**Then** the notes field produces multiple chunks split by paragraph, each within max_tokens

### Scenario 5: Upgrade triggers auto-reindex
**Given** user upgrades CLI from version with chunkVersion=1 to chunkVersion=2
**When** `InitSemantic` runs (on first search command)
**Then** system detects version mismatch, logs "Index outdated, rebuilding...", and runs full reindex automatically

### Scenario 6: gte model (no prefix)
**Given** semantic search is configured with `gte-small`
**When** query is embedded via `EmbedQuery()`
**Then** no prefix is prepended (QueryPrefix is empty string)

### Scenario 7: Heading inside code block ignored
**Given** a document containing a fenced code block with a line starting with `#` (e.g., a bash comment)
**When** the document is chunked
**Then** the `# comment` line inside the code block is NOT treated as a heading — only actual markdown headings outside code blocks produce heading chunks

### Scenario 8: Full header path tracking
**Given** a document with nested headings: H2 "API Reference" > H3 "Endpoints" > H4 "GET /users", and a sibling H3 "Authentication" > H4 "API Keys"
**When** the document is chunked
**Then** the chunk for "GET /users" has `HeaderPath = "API Reference/Endpoints/GET /users"`. The chunk for "API Keys" has `HeaderPath = "API Reference/Authentication/API Keys"`. When H3 "Authentication" appears, the stack pops "Endpoints" before pushing "Authentication".

## Technical Notes

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should `Embed()` be deprecated or kept long-term? (Current plan: keep for backward compat)
- [ ] Should auto-reindex have a `--no-auto-reindex` flag for CI/scripting environments?
