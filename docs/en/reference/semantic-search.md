# Semantic Search

Semantic search helps Knowns search by meaning instead of only exact keywords.

## Main commands

```bash
knowns model list
knowns model download multilingual-e5-small
knowns model set multilingual-e5-small
knowns search --status-check
knowns search --reindex
knowns search "how authentication works" --plain
```

## Search modes

- `keyword`
- `semantic`
- `hybrid`

## Operational note

If semantic components are unavailable, the relevant search paths can safely fall back instead of crashing.
