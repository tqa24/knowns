## Source of Truth

- `KNOWNS.md` is the canonical repo-level guidance file.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `OPENCODE.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are compatibility shims for runtimes that auto-detect those filenames.
- If guidance appears in multiple places, follow this precedence order:
  1. System instructions
  2. Developer instructions
  3. `KNOWNS.md`
  4. Compatibility shim files
  5. Other repository docs
- If a shim file and `KNOWNS.md` differ, treat `KNOWNS.md` as correct.

## TL;DR

- Read `KNOWNS.md` first.
- Use Knowns as the memory layer for humans and the AI-friendly working layer for agents.
- Search before reading; read only the sections and docs relevant to the current task.
- Never manually edit Knowns-managed task or doc markdown.
- Prefer Knowns MCP tools; use the `knowns` CLI only as fallback.
- Let skills handle detailed workflows; use this file for rules, conventions, and context routing.
- Validate before marking work complete.
- Do not revert user changes you did not make.

## Repo Mental Model

- Knowns is the project's memory layer for humans and the AI-friendly operating layer for agents.
- Knowns manages tasks, docs, templates, specs, references, and workflow state in one place.
- Tasks and docs may reference each other using `@task-<id>`, `@doc/<path>`, and `@template/<name>`.
- `KNOWNS.md` defines repo-level operating rules; skills define step-by-step execution flows.
- Long guidance should be retrieved by section, not blindly injected in full on every request.

## How Agents Should Read This File

- Always read `## Source of Truth` and `## TL;DR` first.
- For short or obvious tasks, use the summary sections plus the relevant section only.
- For tool usage questions, read `## Tool Selection` and `## Common Mistakes`.
- For safety-sensitive work, read `## Critical Rules` and `## Git Safety`.
- For large files or docs, read `## Context Retrieval Strategy`.
- For ambiguous requests, search the repo and related docs before asking the user.
- Do not assume the entire file is present in context; retrieve the needed sections when required.

## Tool Selection

- Use Knowns MCP tools first for tasks, docs, templates, validation, and time tracking.
- Use file reading and search tools for local code and text inspection.
- Use shell commands for git, tests, builds, generators, and other terminal operations.
- Prefer targeted retrieval over loading large files in full.

### Preferred Tool Matrix

- `knowns_*`: canonical operations on tasks, docs, templates, validation, and time.
- `read`: inspect a known file.
- `glob`: find files by path pattern.
- `grep`: locate content by regex.
- `bash`: run git, builds, tests, package managers, or other terminal commands.
- `apply_patch`: make small, explicit file edits.
- `task`: delegate large research or multi-step exploration when useful.

## Critical Rules

- Never manually edit Knowns-managed task or doc markdown.
- Search first, then read only relevant docs and code.
- Follow `@task-<id>`, `@doc/<path>`, and `@template/<name>` references before acting.
- Use `appendNotes` for progress updates; `notes` replaces existing notes and should only be used intentionally.
- Validate before marking work complete.
- Use skills for detailed workflow execution instead of duplicating step-by-step process here.

## Git Safety

- Assume the worktree may already contain user changes.
- Never revert or overwrite unrelated user changes unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Do not amend commits unless explicitly requested.
- Do not create commits unless the user explicitly asks for a commit.
- Do not push unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Context Retrieval Strategy

- Treat `KNOWNS.md` as an indexed manual, not a prompt to fully inject every time.
- Read in this order when context is limited:
  1. `## Source of Truth`
  2. `## TL;DR`
  3. The section most relevant to the task
- For large or complex tasks, retrieve additional sections on demand.
- Prefer section headings with stable names so tools can target them precisely.
- If a downstream runtime supports startup loading, preload only the top-level summary and fetch deeper sections lazily.

## References

- Task references use `@task-<id>`.
- Doc references use `@doc/<path>`.
- Template references use `@template/<name>`.
- Follow references recursively before planning, implementation, or validation work.

## Common Mistakes

### Notes vs Append Notes

- Use `appendNotes` for progress updates and audit trail entries.
- Use `notes` only when intentionally replacing the task's notes content.

### CLI Pitfalls

- In `task create` and `task edit`, `-a` means `--assignee`, not acceptance criteria.
- In `doc edit`, `-a` means `--append`.
- Use raw task IDs where a command expects an ID value rather than a mention.
- Use `--plain` for read, list, and search commands, not for create or edit commands.
- Use `--smart` when reading docs through the CLI.

### Retrieval Pitfalls

- Do not read every doc hoping to find the answer; search first.
- Do not repeatedly list the same tasks or docs if the needed context is already loaded.
- Do not quote large file contents when a concise summary is enough.

## Recommended File Roles

- `KNOWNS.md`: canonical repo-level guide.
- Compatibility shim files: lightweight entrypoints that introduce Knowns and redirect runtimes to `KNOWNS.md`.
- Other docs: deeper domain, feature, or workflow references.

## Compatibility Pattern

- Keep shim files short.
- In every shim file, explicitly say that `KNOWNS.md` is canonical.
- Preserve the `<!-- KNOWNS GUIDELINES START -->` and `<!-- KNOWNS GUIDELINES END -->` markers in shim files so tooling can detect and sync them reliably.

## Maintenance Rules

- Update the Knowns generator when the repository's operational rules change.
- Keep top sections stable so automated loaders can depend on them.
- Prefer adding new sections over bloating the TL;DR.
- Keep workflow details in skills when possible; keep `KNOWNS.md` focused on rules, conventions, and routing.
