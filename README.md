> Turn stateless AI into a project-aware engineering partner.

**Knowns is the memory layer for AI-native software development — enabling AI to understand your project instantly.**

Instead of starting from zero every session, AI works with structured, persistent project context.

No repeated explanations.  
No pasted docs.  
No lost architectural knowledge.

Just AI that already understands your system.

⭐ If you believe AI should truly understand software projects, consider giving **Knowns** a star.

## Why Knowns?

AI is powerful — but fundamentally **stateless**.

Every session forces developers to:

- Re-explain architecture
- Paste documentation
- Repeat conventions
- Clarify past decisions
- Rebuild context

This breaks flow and limits AI’s effectiveness.

### AI doesn't lack intelligence.

### It lacks the right context.

**Knowns fixes that.**

---

## What is Knowns - Really?

Knowns provides **persistent, structured project understanding** so AI can operate with full awareness of your software environment.

Think of it as your project's **external brain**.

Knowns connects:

- Specs
- Tasks
- Documentation
- Decisions
- Team knowledge

So AI doesn’t just generate code — it understands what it’s building.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 🧠 Persistent Project Memory

Give AI long-term understanding of your codebase and workflows.

### 🔗 Structured Knowledge

Connect specs, tasks, and docs into a unified context layer.

### ⚡ Smart Context Delivery

Automatically provide relevant context to AI — reducing noise and token usage.

### 🤝 AI-Native Workflow

Transform AI from a tool into a true engineering collaborator.

### 🔐 Self-Hostable

Keep your knowledge private and fully under your control.

---

## How It Works

Knowns sits **above your existing tools** and makes them readable by AI.

Your stack stays the same.

But now:

- Specs → understood
- Tasks → connected
- Docs → usable
- Decisions → remembered

AI stops guessing — and starts contributing.

## Claude Code Skills Workflow

When using Claude Code with Knowns, use skills (slash commands) for a guided workflow:

```
/kn-init     → Read project docs, understand context
/kn-plan     → Take task, gather context, create plan (wait for approval)
/kn-implement → Follow plan, check ACs, track progress
/kn-commit   → Commit with conventional format
```

### Example Session

```
You: /kn-init
Claude: [Reads README, ARCHITECTURE, checks task backlog]
        "Project uses NestJS with CQRS pattern. 3 tasks in-progress..."

You: /kn-plan 42
Claude: [Takes task, reads refs, searches docs]
        "Task #42: Add user authentication

         ## Implementation Plan
         1. Review @doc/patterns/auth
         2. Create AuthModule with JWT strategy
         3. Add login/register endpoints
         4. Write unit tests

         Approve this plan?"

You: Yes

You: /kn-implement 42
Claude: [Follows plan, generates code, checks ACs]
        "✓ AC1: User can login - DONE
         ✓ AC2: JWT token returned - DONE
         ✓ AC3: Tests pass - DONE

         All acceptance criteria complete. Ready to commit?"

You: /kn-commit
Claude: [Creates conventional commit]
        "feat(auth): add JWT authentication

         - Add AuthModule with passport JWT strategy
         - Add login/register endpoints
         - Add unit tests (94% coverage)"
```

## Roadmap

### Self-Hosted Team Sync 🚧 (Planned)

Knowns will optionally support a self-hosted sync server — for teams that want shared visibility without giving up local-first workflows.

- **Real-time visibility** — See who is working on what
- **Shared knowledge** — Sync tasks and documentation across the team
- **Progress tracking** — Track activity over time
- **Full data control** — Self-hosted, no cloud dependency

The CLI and local `.knowns/` folder remain the source of truth.
The server acts only as a sync and visibility layer.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Dev mode
npm run build    # Build
npm run test     # Test
